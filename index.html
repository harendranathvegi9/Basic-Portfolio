					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<hr> <Br>
					<img src="assets/images/adrianaCastro.jpeg">
					My name is Adriana Castro and I am an alumni of Kean University. I graduated in May 2015 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.  As an undergrad at Kean I gained many leadership skills throughout my time working for the Office of Residence Life. I was a Resident Assistant for 3 years and a Community Assistant for 4 years. 

					<p>During my time at Kean University, my main focus was Web Design and Development. With prior experience in Web Development I was able to better understand courses related to Web Development and pick up languages such as HTML and CSS. </p>

					<p>I hope to get an opportunity to practice and learn more languages related to Web Development so that I can expand my skills and showcase work that I know I am capable of doing!</p>
